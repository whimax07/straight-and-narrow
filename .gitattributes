### All files in this repo are supposed to run on Linux so we hard set the End Of Line EOL sequence to LF.


# Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set.
# This attribute marks the path as a text file, which enables end-of-line conversion: When a matching file is added to
# the index, the fileâ€™s line endings are normalized to LF in the index. Conversely, when the file is copied from the
# index to the working directory, its line endings may be converted from LF to CRLF depending on the eol attribute, the
# Git config, and the platform (see explanation of eol below).
* text=auto

# This attribute marks a path to use a specific line-ending style in the working tree when it is checked out. It has
# effect only if text or text=auto is set (see above), but specifying eol automatically sets text if text was left
# unspecified.
* eol=lf
